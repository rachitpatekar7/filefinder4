Setting up MySQL Data

Connecting MySQL with ip address
To set up MySQL data, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to `C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0`.
2. Make the `my.ini` file writable and add the following line:
   ```
   Binding-address=0.0.0.0
   ```
   This allows MySQL to accept connections from any IP address.

C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0


Mysql Scripts
In MySQL Workbench, execute the provided MySQL script (`1_sql_file_info_create.sql`) to set up the necessary user and permissions in MySQL. This script creates a user `arungt` with the password `fi!ef!ndgt!23` and grants it full privileges on all databases.

CREATE USER 'arungt'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'fi!ef!ndgt!23'; 
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'arungt'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES; 
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'arungt'@'localhost';

After setting up MySQL and executing the necessary scripts, databases and tables required for the file finder application will be created. Ensure that the script `1_sql_file_info_create.sql` is executed successfully to create the required database schema.

1_sql_file_info_create.sql

Setting up Code in VSCode
Check correct values in .env

MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_DATABASE=lisney_files_info8
MYSQL_USERNAME=arungt
MYSQL_PASSWORD=fi!ef!ndgt!23
FILE_EXTENSIONS=.xlsx,.xls
N_DAYS=1
SENSITIVE_PATTERNS=password,creditcard
MIN_ROW=3
Setting up a Virtual Environment and Running the Code

1. Navigate to the directory where the file finder code is located (`<filefinder directory>`).
2. Create a virtual environment using Python's `venv` module:  
   
       python -m venv venv
   
3.  Activate the virtual environment:
   
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
   
4. Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
  
      pip install -r requirements.txt
   
5.  Run the Python script `file_info_version_22.py`:
   
       python file_info_version_22.py   
 
 $ cd <filefinder directory>
 $  python -m venv venv 
$ .\venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python file_info_version_22.py
 

If the virtual machine does not run - 
If you encounter issues with running the virtual machine, ensure that the execution policy is set to unrestricted and the `LongPathsEnabled` registry key is set to `1`.
$ Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
Set below value to 1 - 
$Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\LongPathsEnabled
How to Create a .exe file
To create an executable (.exe) file for the file finder application, follow these steps:

1.  Run the following command in the terminal:
   
   pyinstaller --onefile <script_name>.py
  
2.    Replace `<script_name>` with the name of your Python script (`file_info_version_22`).
3. After successful execution, three files will be generated in the folder:
   - `.env`
   - `1_sql_file_info_create.sql`
   - `file_info_version_XYZ.exe`
4. Ensure that both the `.env` file and the executable file (`file_info_version_22.exe`) are in the same folder.
5. Run the `file_info_version_22.exe` file and follow the instructions displayed on the Command Line interface.
6. Wait for the search process to be completed.

Install PowerBI

To utilize PowerBI with the file finder application, follow these steps:

1. Install PowerBI from the Microsoft Store.
2. Install the PowerBI MySQL connector to establish a connection with the MySQL database.
3. When opening a file in PowerBI, select `File` > `Security` > `Not Recommended` for enhanced security measures.
